Terms of Service for BlueLink Messenger™ created by Red Bud Technologies, LLC, how we handle your data: on our end, we have a database of ALL the messages you send. we have permission to view messages, ban users, and moderate foul language. But we only review messages when the AI system flags something horrible to the other user. the older your account's email set age, the less moderation and review there is, AND older users can only talk to that of their age group.
